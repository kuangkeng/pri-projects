The unusually blue color of the sky over Beijing when the city hosted the 26th Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in November 2014. To reduce the air pollution in Beijing, Chinese authorities announced a special week-long holidays for workers and students, halted construction works and banned barbecues and cremations ahead of the summit. This term also refers to the government’s tendency to put on a show for foreigners when the day-to-day reality in China is much bleaker.

    <div id="title"><b>Reincarnation<br>转世</b></div>
When Internet users post about sensitive issues and, as a result, get their social media accounts deleted by service providers, they then “reincarnate” themselves by opening another account. The new handle may end with a number to indicate how many times they have “reincarnated”. For instance, political cartoonist Kuang Biao’s Weibo handle is <a  href="http://weibo.com/u/5057980741"  style="color: #F08080" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">@飚叔钢笔画47</a>.

    <div id="title"><b>RIVER CRAB<br>河蟹</b></div>

    The phrase sounds like the word “harmony” in Mandarin, it refers to government censorship. It is widely used as a verb. Instead of saying something is censored, it is said to be “river-crabbed”. The Chinese have also created <a  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2Fl3q5gZNc"  style="color: #F08080" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">cartoon memes</a> and songs about the grass-mud horses’ fight against the river crabs that threaten the horses’ habitat called Mahler Gobi. Mahler Gobi is a homophone for another Mandarin curse word meaning “your mother’s f---ing c---”.

    <div id="title"><b>GRASS-MUD HORSE<br>草泥马</b></div>
    This imaginary alpaca-creature has become the de facto mascot of Chinese Internet users’ struggle for free expression and a symbol of defiance against Internet censorship. The word, sounds nearly the same as the phrase “f--- your mother” in Mandarin, and was coined in 2009 apparently to skirt censorship of vulgar content. It is also used to criticize the Chinese Communist Party, which often describes itself as the “mother of the people.”
